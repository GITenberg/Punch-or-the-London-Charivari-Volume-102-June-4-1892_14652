    <h2>LOST LUGGAGE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Or the Experiences of a "Vacuus Viator."</i>)</h4>

    <p><i>At the Douane, Ostend.</i>&mdash;Just off <i>Princesse
    Henriette</i>; passengers hovering about excitedly with bunches
    of keys, waiting for their luggage to be brought ashore. Why
    can't they take things quietly&mdash;like <i>me</i>? <i>I</i>
    don't worry. Saw my portmanteau and bag labelled at Victoria.
    Sure to turn up in due time. Some men when they travel insist
    on taking hand-bags into the carriage with them&mdash;foolish,
    when they might have them put in the van and get rid of all
    responsibility. The <i>douaniers</i> are examining the
    luggage&mdash;don't see mine&mdash;as yet. It's all
    <i>right</i>, of course. People who are going on to Brussels
    and Antwerp at once would naturally have their luggage brought
    out first. Don't see the good of rushing about like that
    myself. I shall stay the night here&mdash;put up at one of the
    hotels on the Digue, dine, and get through the evening
    pleasantly at the Kursaal&mdash;sure to be <i>something</i>
    going on. Then I can go comfortably on by a mid-day train
    to-morrow. Meanwhile my luggage still tarries. If I was a
    nervous man&mdash;luckily I'm <i>not</i>. Come&mdash;that's the
    <i>bag</i> at all events, with everything I shall want for the
    night.... Annoying. Some other fellow's bag.... No more luggage
    being brought out. Getting anxious&mdash;at least, just a shade
    uneasy. Perhaps if I asked somebody&mdash;Accost a Belgian
    porter; he wants my baggage ticket. They never gave me any
    ticket. It <i>did</i> occur to me (in the train) that I had
    always had my luggage registered on going abroad before, but I
    supposed <i>they</i> knew best, and didn't worry. I came away
    to get a rest and avoid worry, and I <i>won't</i> worry.... The
    Porter and I have gone on board to hunt for the things. They
    aren't <i>there</i>. Left behind at Dover probably. Wire for
    them at once. No idea how difficult it was to describe luggage
    vividly and yet economically till I tried. However, it will be
    sent on by the next boat, and arrive some time in the evening,
    so it's of no consequence. Now for the Hotel. Ask for the bus
    for the <i>Continental</i>. The <i>Continental</i> is not open
    yet. Very well, the <i>Hôtel de la Plage</i>, then. Closed! All
    the hotels facing the sea <i>are</i>, it seems. Sympathetic
    Porter recommends one in the town, and promises to come and
    tell me as soon as the luggage turns up.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:38%;">
        <a href="images/265.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/265.png"
             alt="'Please, de tings!'" /></a>"Please, de tings!"
    </div>

    <p><i>At the Hotel.</i>&mdash;Find, on getting out of the
    omnibus, that the Hotel is being painted; entrance blocked by
    ladders and pails. Squeeze past, and am received in the hall by
    the Proprietress and a German Waiter. "Certainly they can give
    me a room&mdash;my baggage shall be taken up immed&mdash;" Here
    I have to explain that this is impracticable, as my baggage has
    unfortunately been left behind. Think I see a change in their
    manner at this. A stranger who comes abroad with nothing but a
    stick and an umbrella cannot <i>expect</i> to inspire
    confidence, I suppose. I remark to the Waiter that the luggage
    is sure to follow me by the next boat, but it strikes even
    myself that I do not bring this out with quite a sincere ring.
    Not at all the manner of a man who possesses a real
    portmanteau. I order dinner&mdash;the kind of dinner, I feel,
    that a man who did not intend to pay for it <i>would</i> order.
    I detect this impression in the Waiter's eye. If he dared, I
    know he would suggest tea and a boiled egg as more seemly under
    the circumstances.</p>

    <p><i>On the Digue.</i>&mdash;Thought, it being holiday time,
    that there would be more gaiety; but Ostend just now perhaps a
    little lacking in liveliness&mdash;hotels, villas, and even the
    Kursaal all closely boarded up with lead-coloured shutters.
    Only other person on Promenade a fisher-boy scrooping over the
    tiles in <i>sabots</i>. I come to a glazed shelter, and find
    the seats choked with drifting sand, and protected with barbed
    wire. This depresses me. I did not want to sit down&mdash;but
    the barbed wire <i>does</i> seem needlessly unkind. Walk along
    the sand-dunes; must pass the time somehow till dinner, and the
    arrival of my luggage. Wonder whether it really <i>was</i>
    labelled "Ostend." Suppose the porter thought I said
    "Rochester" ... in that case&mdash;I will <i>not</i> worry
    about it like this. I will go back and see the town.</p>

    <p>I have; it is like a good many other foreign towns. I am
    melancholy. I <i>can't</i> dismiss that miserable luggage from
    my mind. To be alone in a foreign land, without so much as a
    clean sock, is a distressing position for a sensitive person.
    If I could only succeed in seeing a humorous element in it, it
    would be <i>something</i>&mdash;but I can't. It is too forlorn
    to be at all funny. And there is still an hour and a half to
    get through before dinner!</p>

    <p>I have dined&mdash;in a small room, with a stove, a carved
    buffet, and a portrait of the King of the BELGIANS; but my
    spirits are still low. German Waiter dubious about me;
    reserving his opinion for the present. He comes in with a touch
    of new deference in his manner. "Please, a man from de shdation
    for you." I go out&mdash;to find the sympathetic Porter. My
    baggage has arrived? It has; it is at the Douane, waiting for
    me. I am saved! I tell the Waiter, without elation, but with
    what, I trust, is a calm dignity&mdash;the dignity of a man who
    has been misunderstood, but would scorn to resent it.</p>

    <p><i>At the Station.</i>&mdash;I have accompanied the Porter
    to the Terminus, such a pleasant helpful fellow, so
    intelligent! The Ostend streets much less dull at night. Feel
    relieved, in charity with all the world, now that my prodigal
    portmanteau is safely reclaimed. Porter takes me into a large
    luggage-room. Don't see my things just at first. "Your
    baggage&mdash;<i>ere!</i>" says the Porter, proudly, and points
    out a little drab valise with shiny black leather covers and
    brass studs&mdash;the kind of thing a man goes a journey with
    in a French Melodrama! He is quite hurt when I repudiate it
    indignantly; he tries to convince me that it is mine&mdash;the
    fool! There is no other baggage of any sort, and mine can't
    possibly arrive now before to-morrow afternoon, if then.
    Nothing for it but to go back, luggageless, to the
    Hotel&mdash;and face that confounded Waiter.</p>

    <p>Walk about the streets. Somehow I don't feel quite up to
    going back to the Hotel just yet. The shops, which are small
    and rather dimly lighted, depress me. There is no theatre, nor
    <i>café chantant</i> open apparently. If there were, I haven't
    the heart for them to-night. Hear music from a small
    <i>estaminet</i> in a back street; female voice, with fine
    Cockney accent, is singing "<i>Oh, dem Golden Slippers!</i>"
    Wonder where <i>my</i> slippers are!</p>

    <p><i>In my Bedroom.</i>&mdash;I have had to come back at last,
    and get it over with the Waiter. If he felt <i>any</i>
    surprise, I think it was to see me back at all. I have had to
    ask him if he could get me some sleeping-things to pass the
    night in. <i>And</i> a piece of soap. Humiliating, but
    unavoidable. He promised, but he has not brought them. Probably
    this last request has done for me, and he is now communicating
    with the police....</p>

    <p>A tap at my door. "Please, de tings!" says the Waiter. I
    have wronged him. He has brought me <i>such</i> a nightgown!
    Never saw anything in the least like it before. It has flowers
    embroidered all down the front and round the cuffs, and on
    every button something is worked in tiny blue letters, which,
    on inspection, turns out to be "Good-night." I don't quite know
    why, but, in my present state, I find this strangely consoling,
    and even touching&mdash;like a benediction. After all, he
    <i>must</i> believe in me, or he would hardly confide his
    purple and fine linen to me like this. Go to bed gorgeous, and
    dream that my portmanteau, bag, and self-respect are all
    restored to me by the afternoon boat.... There must be
    something in dreams, for, oddly enough, this is exactly what
    <i>does</i> happen.</p>

    <p>Next morning, at breakfast, I am handed a mysterious and, at
    first sight, rather alarming telegram from the Station-master
    at Dover. "Your bones will be sent on next boat." Suspect the
    word in the original was "<i>boxes</i>." But they may call them
    what they like, so long as I get them back again.</p>

    <p>"<i>The Campaign against the Jebus. Gallant Advance of the
    British.</i>" Dear old Mrs. RAM wants to know "who is
    commanding the British forces in the campaign against the
    Jebus" (which she spells "Gibus")? <i>Mr. Punch</i> is glad to
    inform his estimable correspondent that the principal officers
    commanding in the Gibus Campaign are Generals WIDE-AWAKE,

    Keene</i>, by GEORGE SOMES LAYARD." Seeing the name of one of
    your colleagues as the first line of the "Index," I turned to
    page 74 and looked him out. I found him mentioned in an account
    given by Mr. M.H. SPIELMANN of the <i>Punch</i> Dinner, which
    Mr. GEORGE SOMES LAYARD had extracted from <i>Black and
    White</i>, no doubt to assist in making up his book. The
    following is the quotation:&mdash;"The Editor, as I have said,
    presides; should he be unavoidably absent, another
    writer&mdash;usually, nowadays, Mr. ARTHUR
    A'BECKETT&mdash;takes his place, the duty never falling to an
    artist." Then, to show how thoroughly Mr. GEORGE SOMES LAYARD
    is up to date, he adds to the name of Mr. ARTHUR A'BECKETT
    (after the fashion of <i>Mr. Punch</i> in the drama disposing
    of the clown or the beadle), "since dead." Now Mr. ARTHUR
    A'BECKETT is not dead, but very much alive. Do you not think,
    Sir, it would be better were gentlemen who write about yourself
    and your colleagues, to verify their facts before they attempt
    to give obituary notices, even if they be as brief as the one
    in question?</p>

    <h2>STUDIES IN THE NEW POETRY.</h2>

    <p>The world is of course aware by this time that a New Poetry
    has arisen, and has asserted itself by the mouths of many
    loud-voiced "boomers." It has been <i>Mr. Punch's</i> good
    fortune to secure several specimens of this new product, not
    through the intervention of middle men, but from the
    manufacturers themselves. He proposes to publish them for the
    benefit and enlightenment of his readers. But first a word of
    warning. There are perhaps some who believe that a poem should
    not only express high and noble thoughts, or recount great
    deeds, but that it should do so in verse that is musical,
    cadenced, rhythmical, instinct with grace, and reserved rather
    than boisterous. If any such there be, let them know at once
    that they are hopelessly old-fashioned. The New Poetry in its
    <i>highest</i> expression banishes form, regularity and rhythm,
    and treats rhyme with unexampled barbarity. Here and there, it
    is true, rhymes get paired off quite happily in the
    conventional manner, but directly afterwards you may come upon
    a poor weak little rhyme who will cry in vain for his mate
    through half a dozen interloping lines. Indeed, cases have been
    known of rhymes that have been left on a sort of desert island
    of a verse, and have never been fetched away. And sometimes
    when the lines have got chopped very short, the rhymes have
    tumbled overboard altogether. That is really what is meant by
    "impressionism" in poetry carried to its highest excellence.
    There are, of course, other forms of the New Poetry. There is
    the "blustering, hob-nailed" variety which clatters up and down
    with immense noise, elbows you here, and kicks you there, and
    if it finds a pardonable weakness strolling about in the middle
    of the street, immediately knocks it down and tramples upon it.
    Then too there is the "coarse, but manly" kind which swears by
    the great god, Jingo, and keeps a large stock of spread eagles
    always ready to swoop and tear without the least
    provocation.</p>

    <p>However, <i>Mr. Punch</i> may as well let his specimens
    speak for themselves. Here, then, is</p>

            <p>Whereat the shrinking scullery-maid grows pale,</p>

    <p>EPISCOPACY IN DANGER.&mdash;<i>Mr. Punch</i> congratulates
    Dr. PEROWNE, Bishop of Worcester, on his narrow fire-escape
    some days ago, when his lawn sleeves (a costume more
    appropriate for a garden-party than a pulpit) caught fire. It
    was extinguished by a bold Churchwarden. In future let
    Churchwardens be prepared with hose whenever a prelate runs any
    chance of ignition from his own "burning eloquence." If <i>Mr.
    Punch's</i> advice as above is acted upon, a Bishop if "put
    out" may probably mutter, "Darn your hose." But this can be
    easily explained away.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>BETTER AND BETTER.&mdash;The Report last week about Sir
    ARTHUR SULLIVAN was that "he hopes to go to the country
    shortly." So do our political parties. Sir ARTHUR cannot
    restrain himself from writing new and original music at a rapid
    pace. This, is a consequence of his having taken so many
    composing draughts.</p>

    King SOLOMON's words of wisdom, out of his (King SOLOMON's) own
    mines of golden treasures,&mdash;"And of book-making there is
    no end." He substitutes "book-making" for "making of books,"
    and with the poetic CAMPBELL (HERBERT of that ilk) he sings,
    "it makes no difference."</p>

    <h2>OPERATIC NOTES.</h2>

    <p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;<i>L'Amico Fritz</i> at last! Better
    late than never. A Dramatic Operatic Idyl. "Nothing in it," as
    <i>Sir Charles Coldstream</i> observes, except the music, the
    singing, and the acting of Signor DE LUCIA as <i>Fritz</i> Our
    Friend, of M. DUFRICHE as the <i>Rabbi</i> of Mlle. GIULIA
    RAVOGLI as <i>Boy Beppe</i>, of Mlle. BAUERMEISTER as
    <i>Caterina</i>, and of Madame CALVÉ as <i>Suzel</i>. Not an
    indifferent performer or singer among them, and not an
    individual in the audience indifferent to their performance.
    Cherry-Tree Duet, between <i>Suzel</i> and <i>Fritz</i>, great
    hit. Admirably sung and acted, and vociferously encored. Nay,
    they would have had it three times if they could, but though
    Sir DRURIOLANUS sets his face against encores, allowing not too
    much encore but just encore enough, he, as an astute Manager,
    cannot see why persons who have paid to hear a thing only once
    should hear it three times for the same money. No; if they like
    it so much that they want it again, and must have it, and won't
    be happy till they get it, then let them encore their own
    performance of paying for their seats, and come and hear their
    favourite <i>morçeaux</i> over and over again as often as they
    like to pay. He will grant one encore no more. Sir DRURIOLANUS
    is right. Do we insist on Mr. IRVING giving us "To be or not to
    be," or any other soliloquy, all over again, simply because he
    has done it once so well? Do we ask Mr. J.L. TOOLE to repeat
    his author's good jokes&mdash;or his own when his author has
    failed him? No; we applaud to the echo, we laugh till, as Mr.
    CHEVALIER says, "we thort we should ha' died," but we don't
    encore the comic jokes, telling situations, or serious
    soliloquies as rendered by our accomplished histrions.</p>

    <p>Were a collection of pictures made of Mlle. BAUERMEISTER in
    different characters, it would, for interest and variety,
    become a formidable rival of the CHARLES MATHEWS series now in
    the possession of the Garrick Club. To-night she is the busy,
    bustling <i>Caterina</i>, <i>Friend Fritz's</i> housekeeper,
    who, as she has to provide all the food for their breakfast,
    and set it on the table, might be distinguished as <i>Catering
    Caterina</i>. No one now cares to see an Opera without Mlle.
    BAUERMEISTER in it, whether she appear as a dashing lady of the
    Court, probably in a riding-habit, or as a middle-class German
    housekeeper, or as Cupid God of Love, or as <i>Juliet's</i>
    ancient nurse, or as an impudent waiting-maid, or as an unhappy
    mother, or as,&mdash;well,&mdash;any number of characters that
    I cannot now recall, but all done excellently well. Never have
    I heard of her being either "sick or sorry." Some few seasons
    ago I drew public attention to this most useful and ornamental
    <i>artiste</i>, and now I am glad to see that here and there a
    critic has awoke to the fact of her existence, and has done her
    tardy justice. Long may the Bauermeistersinger be able to give
    her valuable assistance, without which no Covent Garden Opera
    Company could possibly be perfect.</p>

    <p>As to <i>L'Amico Fritz</i>, I should suggest that it be
    played in one Scene and two Acts. That this one Scene should be
    the Exterior of Cherry-Tree Farm (which should be
    <i>Fritz's</i>, not the <i>Rabbi's</i>) and that instead of
    lowering the Curtain, the <i>intermezzo</i>&mdash;not I venture
    to opine equal to the marvellous <i>intermezzo</i> in
    <i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i>&mdash;should be played.
    <i>L'Amico</i> is certain of an encore, and this will give the
    singers a rest. It could then commence at nine&mdash;a more
    convenient hour to those who would like to hear every note of
    it, than 8:15, and it would be over by eleven sharp. A nod is
    as good as a wink to Sir DRURIOLANUS, but all the same, Heaven
    forefend I should be guilty of either indiscretion in the
    Imperial Operatorial presence. Thus much at present.</p>

    <p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;"It's the smiles of its AUGUSTUS and
    the heat of its July"&mdash;adapted quotation from "Old Song."
    "I cannot sing the old song"&mdash;except under a sense of the
    deepest and most unpardonable provocation; and when I
    do!!&mdash;<i>Cave canem, ruat coelum!</i> I bring down the
    house as Madame DELILAH's SAMSON did. To-night <i>Manon</i> is
    indeed warmly welcomed. "A nice Opera," says a young lady,
    fanning herself. "I wish it were an iced Opera," groans
    WAGSTAFF, re-issuing one of his earliest side-splitters. M. VAN
    DYCK strong as the weak <i>Des Grieux</i>, but Madame MRAVINA
    apparently not strong enough. "What made author-chap think of
    calling her <i>Manon</i>?" asks languid person in Stalls.
    WAGSTAFF, revived after an iced B.-and-S., is equal to the
    occasion. "Such a bad lot, you know&mdash;regular man-catcher;
    hooked a <i>man on</i>, then, when he was done with, hooked
    another man on. Reason for name evident, see?" The
    <i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i> is the favourite for Derby Night.
    All right up to now, Sir DRURIOLANUS.</p>

    <h2>HISTORY AS SHE IS PLAYED!</h2>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>Questioner.</i> Why should M.V. SARDOU be called the
        Historian of the French Revolution?</p>

        <p><i>Answerer.</i> Because in <i>Thermidor</i> he has
        given an entirely new version of the "Reign of Terror."</p>

        <p><i>Q.</i> Was the "Reign of Terror" very terrible?</p>

        <p><i>A.</i> Not very. At the Opéra Comique it had its
        comic side.</p>

        <p><i>Q.</i> How was that?</p>

        <p><i>A.</i> For instance, <i>les tricoteuses</i> were
        represented by comely, albeit plump maidens, who seemed
        more inclined to dance round a Maypole than haunt a
        scaffold.</p>

        <p><i>Q.</i> Were ROBESPIERRE, ST. JUST, and the rest,
        cruel and vindictive?</p>

        <p><i>A.</i> I should say not; and I found my conclusion on
        the fact that they engaged an actor given to practical
        joking as an officer of the Public Security.</p>

        <p><i>Q.</i> From this, do you take it that ROBESPIERRE
        must have had a subtle sense of humour?</p>

        <p><i>A.</i> I do; and the impression is strengthened by
        his order for a general slaughter of Ursuline Nuns.</p>

        <p><i>Q.</i> Why should he order such a massacre?</p>

        <p><i>A.</i> To catch the heroine of <i>Thermidor</i>, a
        lady who had taken the vows under the impression that her
        lover had been killed by the enemy.</p>

        <p><i>Q.</i> Had her lover been killed?</p>

        <p><i>A.</i> Certainly not; he had preferred to
        surrender.</p>

        <p><i>Q.</i> Can you give me any idea of the component part
        of a revolutionary crowd?</p>

        <p><i>A.</i> At the Opéra Comique, a revolutionary crowd
        seems to consist of a number of mournful loungers, who have
        nothing to do save to take a languid interest in the fate
        of a tearful maiden, and a few <i>gens d'armes</i> a little
        uncertain about their parade-ground.</p>

        <p><i>Q.</i> How do the mournful loungers express their
        interest in the fate of the tearful maiden?</p>

        <p><i>A.</i> By pointing her out one to another, and when
        she is ordered off to execution removing their hats, and
        fixing I their attention on something concealed behind the
        scenes.</p>

        <p><i>Q.</i> What is your present idea of the Reign of
        Terror?</p>

        <p><i>A.</i> My present idea of the Reign of Terror is,
        that it was the mildest thing imaginable. In my opinion,
        not even a child in arms would have been frightened at
        it.</p>

        <p><i>Q.</i> Do you not consider M. MAYER deserving of
        honour?</p>

        <p><i>A.</i> Certainly I do. For has he not removed (with
        the assistance of M. SARDOU and the Opéra Comique) several
        fond illusions of my youth?</p>

    are indeed a sweet creature for adopting my idea so

    <p>Sir MINTING BLOUNDELL, whose criticism on my contribution to
    your well-written journal I invited, complimented me on my
    style, and suggested that when giving my selections it might be
    as well to refer to the "Home Trials" of the horses
    mentioned&mdash;but I venture to disagree with him! Goodness
    knows we all have home trials enough! (Lord ARTHUR and I
    frequently do not speak for a week unless someone is
    present)&mdash;but I do not think these things should be made
    public, and besides, it is an unwritten law amongst "smart"
    people to avoid subjects that "chafe"&mdash;which sounds like
    an anachronism&mdash;whatever that means! Having an opportunity
    of a "last word" on the Derby, I should like to say that,
    although my confidence in my last week's selection, <i>La
    Flêche</i>, is unshaken, I wish to have a second "arrow" to my
    bow in <i>Llanthony</i>&mdash;of whom a very keen judge of
    racing (Lord BOURNEMOUTH to wit) has formed the opinion
    that&mdash;in his own words&mdash;"he will be on the premises"!
    The premises in question being Epsom Downs, there will
    undoubtedly be room for him without his filling an
    unnecessarily prominent position, so I will couple
    <i>Llanthony</i> with <i>La Flêche</i> to supply the probable
    last in the Derby.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, I must say a word or two about the Ladies' Race
    at Epsom on Friday next. There is absolutely no knowing what
    will start for the Oaks nowadays until the numbers go
    up&mdash;and no Turf Prophet will venture a selection until the
    morning of the race&mdash;and <i>this</i> is where the
    perspicuity of an Editor like yourself, <i>Mr. Punch</i>,
    scores a distinct hit&mdash;for such a paltry consideration as
    "knowing nothing about it" is not likely to daunt a woman who
    takes as her motto the well-known line from SHAKSPEARE: "Thus
    Angels rush where Cowards fear to tread!"&mdash;so herewith I
    confidently append my verse selection for the last Mare in the
    Oaks!</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h3>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h3>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, May 23.</i>&mdash;REDMOND,
    Junior, said really funny thing just now. Rising to take part
    in resumed Debate on Irish Local Government Bill, he announced
    in loud angry tone that it would be waste of time to discuss a
    Bill the Government evidently did not intend to press through
    this Session, and he for one would be no party to such a farce.
    Then he went on to talk for half an hour.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Debate on the whole something better than last week's
    contribution. O'BRIEN delivered himself of glowing denunciation
    full of felicitous phrases, all got through in half an hour.
    CHAMBERLAIN followed; has not yet got over startling novelty of
    his interposition in Debate being welcomed by loud cheers from
    Conservatives; thinks of old Aston-Park days, when the cheering
    was, as WEBSTER (not Attorney-General) says, "on the other
    boot." Now, when JOSEPH gets up to demolish his Brethren
    sitting near, Conservatives opposite settle themselves down
    with the peculiar rustling motion with which a congregation in
    crowded church or chapel arrange themselves to listen to a
    favourite preacher. Pretty to watch them as CHAMBERLAIN goes
    forward with his speech, delighting them with surprise to find
    how much better is their position than they thought when it was
    recommended or extolled from their own side. JOSEPH not nearly
    so acrimonious to-night as sometimes. Still, as usual, his
    speech chiefly directed to his former Brethren who sit
    attentive, thinking occasionally with regret of the fatal
    shallowness of the pit, and the absence of arrangement for
    hermetically sealing it. If only&mdash;But that is another
    story. COURTNEY at end of Bench is thinking of still another,
    which has the rare charm of being true. It befel at a quiet
    dinner where JOSEPH, finding himself in contiguity with
    Chairman of Committees, took opportunity of rebuking him for
    his alleged laxity in repressing disorder.</p>

    <p>"I should like to know," he asked, "whether, supposing I
    were to fire a pistol across the House, you would call it a
    breach of order."</p>

    <p>"I don't think, CHAMBERLAIN," said Prince ARTHUR, who was
    sitting at the other side of the table, "that if you were going
    to fire a pistol in the Commons, you would point it across the
    House." TIM HEALY just back from Dublin, where he's been
    appearing in his favourite character of pacificator; followed
    CHAMBERLAIN, and later came SAUNDERSON. But even he suffered
    from prevailing tone of dulness, and WILFRID LAWSON, fast
    asleep in the corner by Cross Benches, did not miss much.
    <i>Business done.</i>&mdash;More talk on Local Government
    Bill.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;If anyone looking on at House of
    Commons at three o'clock this afternoon had predicted that
    within an hour it would be teeming with life, brimming over
    with human interest, he would have been looked upon with cold
    suspicion. NOLAN had taken the floor, and was understood to be
    expressing his deliberate opinion on merits of Irish Local
    Government Bill. He was certainly saying something, but what it
    might be no man could tell. LYON PLAYFAIR, who is up in all
    kinds of statistics, tells me 120 words per minute is the
    average utterance of articulate speech. NOLAN was doing his
    300, and sometimes exceeded that rate. Not a comma in a column
    of it. A humming-top on the subject would have been precisely
    as instructive and convincing. Some twenty Members sat there
    fascinated by the performance. It was not delivered in a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page275"
       id="page275"></a>[pg 275]</span> monotone, in which case one
       could have slept. NOLAN was evidently arguing in incisive
       manner, shirking no obstacle, avoiding no point in the Bill,
       or any hit made by previous speaker. His voice rose and fell
       with convincing modulation. He seemed to be always dropping
       into an aside, which led him into another, that opened a
       sort of Clapham Junction of converging points. One after the
       other, the Colonel, with full steam up, ran along; when he
       reached terminus of siding, racing back at sixty miles an
       hour; and so up and down another. Only guessed this from
       modulation of his voice and the intelligent nodding of the
       head with which he compelled the attention of
       ATTORNEY-GENERAL for IRELAND. For just over half an hour he
       kept up this pace, and, saving a trot for the avenue, fell
       back into his seat gasping for breath, having concluded a
       sentence nine hundred words long worked off in three minutes
       by the astonished clock.</p>

    has spread a feeling of joy and contentment throughout Althorpe
    and Mid-Northamptonshire. The latest news, brought down just
    now by MARJORIBANKS, is "BOBBY is doing as well as can be
    expected." <i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Irish Local Government
    Bill read Second Time, by 339 votes against 247.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Hail! Sir HENRY WIGGIN, Bart, M.P.;
    B.B.K., as ARTHUR ORTON called himself when resident in the
    wilds of Australia, and explained that the style imported
    Baronet of the British Kingdom. <i>Now</i> we know what was the
    meaning of that foray upon the House the other day, when, with
    the Chairman in the Chair, and Committee fully constituted, the
    waggish WIGGIN walked adown the House, with his hat cocked on
    one side of his head, in defiance of Parliamentary etiquette.
    The Birthday Gazette was even then being drafted, and to-day
    the wanton WIGGIN is Sir HENRY, Baronet of the United Kingdom.
    <i>Not</i> a more popular announcement in the list. An honest,
    kindly, shrewd WIGGIN it is, with a face whose genial smile all
    people, warming under it, instinctively return.</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;WIGGIN made B.B.K.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Quite a long time reaching Vote on
    Account; two hours taken for discussion of Birmingham Water
    Bill; Gentlemen in Radical camp much exercised about size of
    fish in streams annexed for purposes of Birmingham water
    supply. CHAMBERLAIN, who has charge of Bill, says he never
    caught one longer than two inches. DILLWYN protests that
    fishing in same waters he rarely caught one less than a pound
    weight. Evidently a mistake somewhere. House perplexed, finally
    passed Bill through Committee.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Then Rev. SAM SMITH wants to know more about Polynesian
    Labour Traffic. The NOBLE BARON who has charge of Colonial
    affairs in Commons, whilst controverting all his statements,
    says "everyone must admit that the Hon. Member has spoken from
    his heart." "Which," NOVAR says, "it reminds me of the couplet
    <i>Joe Gargery</i> meant to put on the tombstone of his
    lamented father, 'What-sume'er the failings on his part,
    Remember, reader, he were that good in his hart.'"</p>

    <p>At length in Committee of Supply; Vote on Account moved; Mr.
    G. on his feet wanting to know you know; doesn't once mention
    the Dissolution; but puts it to Prince ARTHUR whether, really,
    the time hasn't come when House should learn something with
    respect to intentions of Government touching finance, their
    principal Bills, and, in short, "so far foreshadowing the
    probable termination of the Session?" Wouldn't on any account
    hurry him; any day he likes will do; only getting time
    something should be said. Prince ARTHUR, gratefully
    acknowledging Mr. G.'s kind way of putting it, agreed with his
    view. Some day he will tell us something; to-day he will say
    nothing. A pretty bit of by-play; excellently done by both
    leading Gentlemen; perfectly understood by laughing House.</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Shadow of Dissolution gathering
    close.</p>

    <p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;I see TAY PAY, in the interesting
    Sunday journal he admirably edits, reproaches me because, in
    this particular page of history, "Mr. SEXTON," he says, "is
    derided constantly and shamefully." <i>Anglicè</i>:
    Occasionally when, in a faithful record of Parliamentary
    events, SEXTON's part in the proceedings must needs be noticed,
    it is gently hinted that among his many admirable qualities
    terseness of diction is not prominent. In fact he has been
    sometimes alluded to by the playful prefix WINDBAG. If TAY PAY
    had been content to administer reproof, it would have been
    well. But he goes on to discuss SEXTON's parliamentary style,
    and comes to this conclusion:&mdash;"Mr. SEXTON's one fault as
    a speaker is that he does not proportion his observations
    sufficiently at certain stages in his speeches; and that
    preparation sometimes has the effect of tempting him to
    over-elaboration." If TAY PAY likes to put it that way, no one
    can object. Only, space in this journal being more valuable,
    the same thing is said in a single word.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
